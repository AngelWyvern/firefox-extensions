# <p align=center>Big Shorts Player</p>

A basic browser extension that redirects YouTube Shorts links to the standard player URL (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qwerty â†’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwerty).

I first made this as a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/AngelWyvern/big-shorts-ext) back when the Shorts player was missing important UI controls (i.e. volume slider and other stuff). I've now ported this over to Firefox as I'm switching browsers.
